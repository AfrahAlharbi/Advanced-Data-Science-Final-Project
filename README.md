## Breast Cancer

Frist of all the aim is to explore breast cancer dataset. The features of the dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. This data analysis is useful to predict the breast cancer cells in human body.

### let see what we have in our data set:

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 569 entries, 0 to 568
Data columns (total 32 columns):

So we have 569 records against 32 columns and all of them have 569 non-null records and the data type is float64.

Target columns is the diagnosis

AS seen in chart the Number of Benign is 357 and Number of Malignant is  212
